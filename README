PROTEIN-RNA BENCHMARK V1.0 README FILE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Thanks for downloading the Protein-RNA benchmark v1.0. This benchmark is composed of 106 cases,with 5 unbound-unbound, 4 unbound-pseudo-unbound, 62 unbound-bound, 5 unbound-model, 8 model-unbound, 19 model-bound and 3 model-model cases. You will find here the directories corresponding to all these cases, named according to their complex PDB references:

Within each directory you will find the following files (XXXX represents the corresponding directory name for each case):


	- XXXX_complex.pdb		The unmodified coordinates of the considered protein and RNA chains from the complex RCSB PDB file

	- XXXX_complex.fasta		The FASTA format sequences of the considered protein and RNA chains from the complex RCSB PDB file

	- XXXX_prot.pdb			The unmodified coordinates of the considered protein chain/s from the protein unbound RCSB PDB file or coordinates 
					from the protein model pdb (for model-unbound, model-bound or model-model cases)

	- XXXX_prot.fasta		The FASTA format sequence/s of the considered protein chain/s from the protein unbound RCSB PDB file or input FASTA format sequence/s                                              from the complex RCSB PDB file used for building the protein homology model (for model-unbound, model-bound or model-model cases)

	- XXXX_prot.resnum		Residue numbering correspondence between complex and individual protein structures

	- XXXX_RNA.pdb			The unmodified coordinates of the considered RNA chain/s from the RNA unbound RCSB PDB file or coordinates from the 
                                        complex RCSB PDB file (for unbound-bound or model-bound cases) or from the RNA model pdb (for unbound-model or model-model cases)

	- XXXX_RNA.fasta		The FASTA format sequence/s of the considered RNA chain/s from the RNA unbound RCSB PDB file or from the 
                                        complex RCSB PDB file (for unbound-bound, model-bound and for unbound-model or model-model cases as the input sequences for the modelling)
	
	- XXXX_RNA.resnum		Residue numbering correspondence between complex and individual RNA structures


In unbound-model, model_unbound, model-bound and model-model directories you can also find the following files:


	- XXXX_PROTtemplate.pdb		The unmodified coordinates of the considered protein chain/s from the template RCSB PDB file

	- XXXX_PROTtemplate.fasta	The FASTA format sequence/s of the considered protein chain/s from the template RCSB PDB file

	- XXXX_prot-template.ali	The alignment of protein and template sequences used for modelling the unbound protein structure

	- XXXX_RNAtemplate.pdb		The unmodified coordinates of the considered RNA chain/s from the template RCSB PDB file

	- XXXX_RNAtemplate.fasta	The FASTA format sequence/s of the considered RNA chain/s from the template RCSB PDB file

	- XXXX_RNA-template.ali		The alignment of RNA and template sequences used for modelling the unbound RNA structure
