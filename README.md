The Protein-RNA benchmark is composed of 106 cases, with 5 unbound-unbound, 4 unbound-pseudo-unbound, 62 unbound-bound, 5 unbound-model, 8 model-unbound, 19 model-bound cases and 3 model-model. The main objective of this benchmark is to foster the development of new protein-RNA docking algorithms and contribute to the better understanding and prediction of protein-RNA interactions.
